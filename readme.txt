Long page loads aren't fun for anyone. Use WPSocialite to take control of heavy social sharing links and load them how you want!

== Description ==

No one likes long load times, but we all want to be able to share our content via Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks. These take a long time to load. Paradox? Not anymore! With WPSocialite (utilizing David Bushell's amazing SocialiteJS plugin [http://www.socialitejs.com/]) we can manage the loading process of our social sharing links. Load them on hover, on page scroll, and more!

= Template Tag =
`<?php
$args = array(
    'size' => 'large', //choose which size buttons to display.
    'url' => 'http://google.com', //use this to override the url that is sent to WPSocialite. Not recommended to use in loop.
    'button_override' => 'facebook,twitter-share,twitter-follow,pinterest,linkedin,gplus' //used to override buttons that are displayed. Add and remove as needed.
);
wpsocialite_markup( $args ); ?>`


= Shortcode =

`[wpsocialite size="small" url="http://google.com" button_override="facebook,twitter-share,twitter-follow,pinterest,linkedin,gplus"]`

== Installation ==

1. Download the wpsocialite folder and upload it to {your-wp-directory}/wp-content/plugins folder.
2. Visit Your-website.com/wp-admin/plugins.php and activate WPSocialite.
3. Head to Settings->Discussion and scroll to "WPSocialite" settings to configure the plugin.

Thats it!


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= So what does this do? =

WPSocialite uses socialite.js and implements it into the Wordpress workflow, adding it automatically (or manually, if you choose) to your content.

Socialite.js allows us to define when we would like to load our social sharing links. For example, if we have a page with ten posts, each with their own set of Facebook Like, Google+ Share, and Twitter Share links, they could take some time to load. Using WPSocialite, you can load those individually when the user scrolls or hovers over a specific post.

= Can I add the social links myself instead of letting the plugin place them? =

Of course! Use the "manual" setting under the plugin settings (Settings->Discussion) and then use the following template tags in your template to display the links however you please.

The first template tag is to echo out the markup and display WPSocialite:

`<?php wpsocialite_markup('large'); ?>`

The second template tag is to get WPSocialite's mark up and place it in an object, if needed:

`<?php
    $wpsocialite =  get_wpsocialite_markup('small');
    echo $wpsocialite;
?>`

When using this method, be sure to include "large" or "small" inside the function (as seen above) to define which style WPSocialite will use to display your social links.

You can also use the shortcode `[wpsocialite size="large"]` or `[wpsocialite size="small"]` in a post or page and it will display the social sharing buttons anywhere you like.

= Can I disable the plugins script loading in order to manually add the CSS and Javascript myself? =

Yes! By dropping the following code into your wp-config.php file you will tell the plugin to not load its CSS and Javascript and give you the ability to add it manually.

`define('WPSOCIALITE_LOADSCRIPTS', false);`

Setting this to false tells the plugin to not load any Javascript. If you want the plugin to automatically load it again, simply set this to true or remove it completely.

To stop the plugin from automatically loading its CSS, you would use the following line in the same way:

`define( 'WPSOCIALITE_LOADSTYLES', false);`


Please note, when using this method if you are loading any social networks with an external file (Pinterest, for example), you will also have to load the javascript file associated with the network (wpsocialite/Socialite/extensions/socialite.pinterest.js).
